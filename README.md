Our project focuses on improving the efficiency of the company's invoicing process, especially the automation of paper invoice processing. Our goal is to develop a solution that integrates identification, classification and processing of incoming paper invoices into the current electronic invoice management system. In this way, we improve process efficiency, reduce errors and save time and resources in the company.
